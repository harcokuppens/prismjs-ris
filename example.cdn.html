# This is a general note about the file itself.
# This entire record was manually entered and has been verified.
% This is a good place to add more detailed thoughts about the citation.
% The abstract for this article is particularly relevant.

N1  - This is a note that will be imported into a notes field.

// A double-slash comment block.
// I plan to use this article in my literature review.

    <h2>About comments in RIS</h2>
    <p>
      The core issue is that the RIS format has no official, public, and universally
      accepted specification. The format was created by a company, Research
      Information Systems, and while many other software tools reverse-engineered it,
      there is no central authority that dictates the rules.
    </p>

    Because of this, different parsers (e.g., in Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, or a
    custom script) might handle "non-standard" lines in slightly different ways.

    <h3>A Safe Practice</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>To minimize the risk of an error, follow these best practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Place comments on their own lines:</b> Don't try to add them at the end
          of a data line.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b
            >Start the line with a character or string that is clearly not a valid
            two-letter tag.</b
          >
          <code>%, #, --, //</code> are all good choices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Leave a blank line before and after the comment block</b> to separate it
          from the actual citation data. This makes it even clearer to the parser
          that the lines are not part of the record.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In conclusion, while there is no official "comment" syntax in the RIS format,
      the use of a non-conforming tag like <code>%</code> is the closest and most
      reliable workaround. The risk of a fatal error is small, but it's important to
      be aware that the RIS standard is not strictly enforced, and different parsers
      may behave differently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is listing of reliable strings that can be used to start a comment line
      in an RIS file. These strings are chosen because they do not match the required
      "XX - " format of a valid RIS tag and are therefore highly likely to be ignored
      by parsers.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        &nbsp;<b>#</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common in many coding languages.
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;<b>%</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used in LaTeX.</li>
      <li>
        &nbsp;<b>//</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common for single-line comments in
        many programming languages.
      </li>
      <li>&nbsp;<b>--</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used for comments in SQL.</li>
      <li>
        &nbsp;<b>_</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple character that won't
        be confused with a tag.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advice</h3>
    Just use a % character followed by a space at the beginning of a line to start a
    comment. Put a comment above the publication and separate it with multiple empty
    lines above it and one between the comment and the publication. This makes clear
    to which publication the comment belongs to, but it is clearly separated from the
    publication.
